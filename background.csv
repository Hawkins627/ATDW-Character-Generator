1,"Algae Farmer – You spent most of your life working one of the giant algae farms that feeds most of the world, probably after inheriting the job from your parents. Choose: +1 Resolve or +1 Survival."
2,"Blue Collar Worker – You’re just another of the million workers that maintain the machinery—always unseen, always abused. When the opportunity arrived to leave it all behind, you just took it. Screw being poor, the world shall be your oyster! Choose: +1 Technology or +1 Perception."
3,"Celebrity – Back on Earth (or maybe even Mars), when your millions of followers seemed ready to turn their fleeting attention to the next big thing, it was time for the ultimate publicity stunt: becoming a Deep Diver and blogging about your experiences. Your agent thinks you’ve lost your mind, and you know that this is a potentially deadly decision, but what’s worse: to die and have millions remember you, or to slowly fade into anonymity? Choose: +1 Manipulation or +1 Perception."
4,"Data Miner – After years of 16-hour shifts in front of a screen, you had enough. Sure, things could be much worse (you could be picking through garbage mounds outside of town, like so many others), but you knew you were destined for greater things. So you left it all behind, eyes firmly set on the future, whatever it may hold. Choose: +1 Science or +1 Technology."
5,"Hedge Fund Kid – You’re one of the lucky ones—living the high life far from the rest of the world’s hardships. Still, life became stale after a while and you couldn’t just sit on your hands while others made history. You left it all behind, and now you have nothing but your determination. Choose: +1 Manipulation or +1 Resolve."
6,"Ocean Sweeper – The oceans may be dead, but they’re full to the brim with plastic and other useful materials. You and your crew spent months in the world’s silent, eerie waters, the smell of rotten matter and toxic algae forever a part of your life. Surely this is not all life has to offer? With that question in mind, you left the oceans behind in search of a better future. Choose: +1 Technology or +1 Pilot."
7,"Petty Criminal – Small robberies and hustles got you by, day to day. You made some enemies, the kind that can’t be simply paid off, and you had to get as far from them as possible. Choose: +1 Manipulation or +1 Close Combat."
8,"Plastic Miner – Years spent in the old world’s plastic deposits were enough to make you want to leave the planet for good. Nothing out here could be possibly worse. Choose: +1 Medical Aid or +1 Survival."
9,"Scavenger – As millions of others, you carve your life from the old world’s remnants and the garbage of those who came before. It’s not a pretty life and most of the time it’s a short one. After a close call with one of the garbage gangs, you had enough. Whether your money was stolen or saved, you took your ticket and never looked back. Choose: +1 Stealth or +1 Survival."
10,"Warlord – The 22nd century is as rife with conflict as ever. You managed to take advantage of that situation—a situation you did not create. Someone had to do the killing, it might as well have been you. Choose: +1 Ranged Combat or +1 Manipulation."
