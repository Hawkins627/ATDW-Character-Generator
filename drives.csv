1,"Wealth","It’s what makes the world spin and the stars shine. You figure being set for life is easily worth a few months of pain and suffering."
2,"Power","Drake Industries is the largest, most powerful corporation in all of human space. If you want some of that power, there’s no better way to get in than impressing the big guys with your feats and discoveries at Karum Station. This is the fastest, straightest path to power, and you are taking it."
3,"Fame","What good is being alive if nobody knows who you are? Sure, money can build companies, buy buildings or surgeries or a place on one of those talk shows, but the kind of glory a Diver gets? That’s unmatched. You just need one big, juicy mission to send you into the world of paparazzi and millions of sycophants dying to know what you had for breakfast."
4,"Wanderer’s Lust","Earth, Moon and Mars are not enough for you. You need more. There’s a whole universe out there to explore and you want to see as much of it as possible."
5,"Knowledge","Learning the universe’s secrets never seemed as possible as it does now. The Àrsaidh are humanity’s shortcut to it all, the key to a thousand million doors. You must be the one opening as many of them as you can."
6,"Information","A family member or friend disappeared during an expedition and you just couldn’t let it go. You have come to search for them, even if you don’t know where to begin."
7,"Espionage","Whether you work for Chou Technologies, Eclipse or even Whirlwind News, you’re here to see the Station’s inner workings, to learn first-hand how the Karum Station Authority operates."
8,"Somewhere to Belong","You’ve been alone (or at least felt that way) for your whole life. You’re sick of it. It’s time to find a cause larger than yourself, a place you can call home, a family that will risk their lives for you. Bonds forged in the void are forever and that is all you want."
9,"Nothing Can Stop You","You’re here to prove—to yourself, to the world, to that asshole back on Earth—that there is nothing you cannot do, if you dedicate enough time and effort to it. You will become the most successful Diver ever to travel the galaxy and nobody will ever doubt you again!"
10,"Adrenaline Junkie","You’ve walked the Paris wastes alone, climbed inside the Johannesburg reactor crater and done enough space diving that it’s essentially routine. The only thing that’s left to do is explore the universe, and you are so ready for it."
